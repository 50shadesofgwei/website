                    <p><b>Hello, I'm Jonathan. I am 24 years old and I live in Manchester, UK.</b> I speak English, Spanish, and Russian, and as of December 2025 am in the top 0.3% of chess players worldwide. I have made this website to give anyone interested a way to quickly get up to speed on who I am and what I do.</p>
                    <div class="mission-box short-version">
                      <h2 style="color: var(--text);">Short Version:</h2>
                      <p>I want to launch a company on the bleeding edge of a new technology.</p>
                      <p>Working with people in the top 0.1% of agency, ambition, and intellect is very important to me.</p>
                      <p>I really value clear communication and optimising for actionable plans instead of meandering intellectual debates.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mission-box long-version">
                      <h2 style="color: var(--text);">Long Version:</h2>
                      <p>This website comes about following the realisation that <b>the best work is always done in a team</b>, and to go far, one must travel in a pack. With that in mind, I'm broadcasting this message into the abyss on the off-chance that someone should see it, respond to it, and that together we can create a <s>cult</s> tight-knit group of extremely driven and extremely high-performing individuals.</p>
                      <p>It is worth mentioning that I am not naturally inclined towards any beating around the bush regarding the work at hand. A tendency I have noticed is that discussions around work can quickly devolve into tangental, or often completely unrelated (but reasonable-sounding) discussions on topics that do not make any progress towards the main goal. This is an extremely dangerous failure case. Nothing of import is ever achieved through this endless hypothesising and intellectual self-gratification; great things come about by <b>relentlessly optimising for action</b> and course-correcting along the way.</p>
                      <p>If your work is shit, I will tell you so. If my work is shit, you should absolutely tell me the same. I won't be offended, and if I am, I'll get over it; the small emotional pain of constructive criticism in the moment is in every case preferable to allowing a mistake to compound across time. Although difficult, it would appear as though adopting this philosophy of 'just bluntly stating the problem' dramatically decreases iteration time and allows problems to be solved immediately and without confusion.</p>
                      <p>Regarding what is to be worked on, there are a handful of fields which I believe have the potential to make a world-changing impact in the next 10 years. In no particular order, they are:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Quantum Computing</li>
                        <li>Nuclear Fusion</li>
                        <li>Gene Editing</li>
                        <li>Robotics</li>
                        <li>Extended Reality (AR, VR)</li>
                        <li>Nanotechnology</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>If you work in or are seriously interested in any of these fields, please <a href="contact.html" style="text-decoration: underline">reach out</a>. I want to talk with you.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>If there is one thing that you remember from this website, it should be that I want to make millions of dollars alongside exceptionally talented, exceptionally <i>hardcore</i> people. It must be understood that there is zero tolerance for mediocrity.</p>
