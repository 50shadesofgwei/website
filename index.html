                      <p><b>Hello, I'm Jonathan. I am 24 years old and I live in Manchester, UK.</b> I speak English, Spanish, and Russian, and as of December 2025 am in the top 0.3% of chess players worldwide. I have made this website to give anyone interested a way to quickly get up to speed on who I am and what I do.</p>

                      <h2 style="color: var(--text);">Short Version:</h2>
                      <p>I want to manafacture a commercially viable quantum computer.</p>
                      <p>Working with people in the top 0.1% of agency, ambition, and intellect is very important to me.</p>
                      <p>I put a great deal of emphasis on clear communication and optimising for actionable plans, as opposed to endless debating and busywork.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mission-box long-version">

                      <p>This website comes about from the fact that to run far, one must run in a team. With that in mind, I am broadcasting this message out into the abyss on the off-chance that someone should see it, respond to it, and that together we can create a <s>cult</s> tight-knit group of extremely driven and extremely high-performing individuals.</p>
                      <p>It is worth mentioning that I am not naturally inclined towards any beating around the bush regarding the work at hand. A tendency I have noticed is that discussions around work can quickly devolve into tangental, or often completely unrelated (but reasonable-sounding) discussions on topics that do not make any progress towards the main goal. This is an extremely dangerous failure case. Very rarely is anything of import achieved through such endless hypothesising and intellectual self-gratification; it would appear that great things only come about by <b>relentlessly optimising for action</b> and course-correcting along the way.</p>
                      <p>The optimal working environment would appear to be one where, If one's work is of poor quality, this point is immediately raised. I will not be offended if I am to be the recipient of such criticism, and if I do take offence, I'll get over it; the small emotional pain of constructive criticism in the moment is in every case preferable to allowing a mistake to compound across time. Although difficult, it would appear as though adopting this philosophy of 'just bluntly stating the problem' dramatically decreases iteration time and allows problems to be solved immediately and without confusion.</p>
