          <p data-translate="work0">My first 'project' was teaching myself to play the guitar at the age of 12. I have played ever since, and like to think I'm half decent at it. You can judge that for yourself <a href="https://www.instagram.com/___voodoochild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>.</p>
          <p data-translate="work0b">A lifelong, ongoing, project that I hold quite dear is reading. I have always been a voracious reader - I read the Hobbit and LOTR at 11. I later became interested in Psychology and Philosophy; works by Jung, Nietzche and Dostoyevsky remain some of the most important literature in my life.</p>
          <p data-translate="work1">In 2021 I dropped out of university to start working in MEV research and development at what is now <a href="https://www.smg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration: underline">Special Mechanisms Group</a>.</p>
          <p data-translate="work2">After this, I started programming searchers and trading bots on my own; work for which I was awarded around $70,000 throughout 2023 and early 2024 in grants from organiasations such as <a href="https://gmx.io/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration: underline">GMX</a> and <a href="https://www.synthetix.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration: underline">Synthetix</a>.</p>
          <p data-translate="work3">A part of this work surrounding funding rate arbitrage is public and can be found <a href="https://github.com/50shadesofgwei/funding-rate-arbitrage" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>.</p>
          <p data-translate="work4">This work later developed into a small private trading operation, for which $1m of investor capital was raised.</p>
          <p data-translate="work5">In 2025 I was headhunted to join <a href="https://chaoslabs.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration: underline">Chaos Labs</a> as a Researcher specialising in on-chain Perpetual Futures, which is where I am currently working.</p>
